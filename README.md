A picture in picture application for a mini preview of a window

A friend asked me for a way to keep a preview of a game open in a tiny window where it would always be on top of everything 
without having to clutter up his screen space by doing a split screen configuration. This little widget is the result. Basicly:
  1) Open the app
  2) Click a window
  3) Resize your preview as needed
  
You can move the window by draging the gray button.
You can change the target window with the green button.
If you hold shift or right click the green button you will have a 5 second delay before teh window is selected.
(added this to switch into fullscreen programs)

Unfortunatly it should be noted that not all the applications work as expected.
Some:
   - The screen doesn't actualy update
   - Display a black screen
Others:
   - Work as expected providing a live preview
